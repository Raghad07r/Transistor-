# NPN transistor 
how it works?
circuit diagram, output characteristics curve, and applications. It is a bipolar junction transistor mainly used for current amplification and switching purposes. BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistor) are divided into two types i.e. NPN transistor and PNP transistor. Both transistors are different in terms of their electrical composition and construction, however, both are used for amplification and switching purposes in one way or the other.

# NPN transistor is a bipolar junction transistor(BJT) 
composed of 3 semiconductor layers in a way that one P-doped layer(Base) is sandwiched between two N-doped layers(Emitter & Collector) and is mainly used for current amplification and fast switching.
In NPN transistors, the majority charge carriers are electrons and thus conduction is carried out by the flow of electrons from emitter to collector.
